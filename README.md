# Dehook

Dehook is a simple browser extension inspired by [Unhook](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/unhook-remove-youtube-rec/khncfooichmfjbepaaaebmommgaepoid).

It's main purpose is to limit Youtube usage and don't allow to simply change settings. Changes should be password protected and reverted to default after some time.

I want to use it by myself, I don't care about distribution.

I've saved my current Unhook settings to @docs/settings.html for reference.

Use Chrome integration to investigate Youtube pages and what HTML elements should be disabled.
